# What do I use?

The following is a list of the tools that I use daily. This page
was inspired by [Wes Bros](https://wesbos.com/uses). See more pages like this [here](https://uses.tech).

## 🐧 OS + Hardware

- I am currently using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) with [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)

- I have moved back to using a custom-built PC after using my laptop for a few months

## ✔️ Terminal

- I use the [foot terminal](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/foot) with [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/)
- I use [fish 🐟 shell](https://fishshell.com/) as my shell

### 🧰 CLI Tools


- [nh](https://github.com/viperML/nh): A nix helper CLI, an improved nix builder. Displays nicer output when building.
- [atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/): To sync my shell history between multiple devices. Also makes sure it is backed up.

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Really nice fuzzy search tool
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A better version of `cat`
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): A great tool for jumping between multiple directories.
- [task](https://taskfile.dev/): An alternative to makefiles. A task runner, used within my projects, i.e. `task lint`
