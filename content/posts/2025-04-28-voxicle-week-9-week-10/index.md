### Last 2 week

Again got really busy with some personal stuff, and stuff at work so didn't really have much motivation to work
on this project. But I have been forcing myself to code, so at least make some progeres.

I did the following:

- Worked out we can use row level security in Postgres for better authorization
- Added lots more tests
- Edit Feedback
  - Dynamic URL using Alpine
- Figure out duplication bug
- Filter on search
- More filter options

### Next Week

Next week I want to;

- Tidy up the UI for main feedback page
- Better error modals
- Implement RLS in Postgres
