### This week

I did the following:

- Finish core feedback page
  - Add new feedback
  - upvote
  - display as list or grid
- Stretch
  - try to implement basic RBAC (more of a PoC)


However I got a busy with other random pieces of work that come up that kept me busy. Hopefully this week will be
more productive.

### Next Week

Next week I want to;

- Finish core feedback page
  - search
  - display as list or grid
  - email updates when a feature has been completed
  - more filter options
- Stretch
  - public/private views

Carry on working on the core feature set and make it so we can share with other people.
