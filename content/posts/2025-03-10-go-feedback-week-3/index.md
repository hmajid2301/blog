### Week 3

I finished off the auth flow this week, decided to move over to using the wristband UI instead of using my own components.
It ended up being a lot of code which was nice to actually delete and I think the wristband setup is pretty nice
and slick. I had to adjust slightly how I will create users in my own DB but it wasn't a big deal.

I also migrated some of my UI to use the DaisyUI library, which should simplify the amount of CSS I have to manage
on my own.

I also started the onboarding flow, after the user has signed up where they create a new organization. Which
should be finished early next week.
