If you use a FairPhone, or a phone running [eOS/MurenaOS](https://e.foundation/e-os/), which is as degoogled version of
Android (no affiliation to me besides I use their devices/OS).

Sometimes the app store "App Lounge" gets stuck updating apps, my old solution was to delete the app and reinstall it
but that can be a pain. Then I discovered a slightly better solution.

- Go to settings
- Apps & Notifications
- Find App Lounge
- Then go to Storage & cache
- Clear storage and "Delete app data"

You will need to log in again to the app, but the update process shouldn't get stuck anymore hopefully.
