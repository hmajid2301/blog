Cricket is back this week, so I didn't have as much time as I would over the weekend as I was out playing both weekends.
But I made progress every day even a little on Voxicle. I need to work out, what the minimum features I want before
I start to market and share with others to try it and provide feedback.

## Last Week

- Fixed my Tailwind LSP for a better DevEx
- Improved my Gitlab CI file when building the dev Docker image
- Improved the UI
- Allow users to change the sort filters i.e. latest or oldest

## Next Week

- Implement Authorization using RLS in Postgres
- Better error modals (fixed)
