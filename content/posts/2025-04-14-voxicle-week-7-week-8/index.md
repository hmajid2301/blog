### Last 2 week

Some stuff kept me busy so I couldn't really work on my project work.

I did the following:

- Added tests
  - E2E with new skeleton
  - How to debug E2E tests with delve (i.e. the server running separately)
- Fixed a bunch of TODOs in the code base
- Delete feedback


However I got a busy with other random pieces of work that come up that kept me busy. Hopefully this week will be
more productive.

### Next Week

Next week I want to;

- Figure out duplication bug
- Filter on search
- More filter options
